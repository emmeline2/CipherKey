# CipherKey
RSA  public-key  algorithm  used  for  communicating  characters  of  the English alphabet with plaintext 1 representing A, 2 representing B, 3 representing C and so on. Plaintext 27 represents a blank space. The public key pair is (e,n) = (27, 55), i.e. ciphertext Cis obtained from the plaintext Pusing the formula C = P2^7 mod  55.
